# ALPHA SMS ADMIN PANEL 

A complete admin panel for OTP/virtual number management.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
sudo python3 main.py
```

Then open **http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP** in your browser. The server listens on HTTP port 80, so no port number is needed in the URL.

Or just double-click **start.bat** on Windows.
